To-do: 




Create a baseline policy document: who needs sudo, group roles, and file access requirements for a small team (e.g., admin, dev, auditor).




On an Ubuntu VM, create users and groups according to the policy (use useradd, groupadd).




Assign minimal privileges: configure sudoers using any text editor with least-privilege rules, set sudo rules for specific commands only.




Use POSIX permissions + ACLs for a shared project folder so that only the intended group has write access; others have read-only.




Enable simple auditing (auditd) to log changes to /etc/sudoers and /etc/passwd.




In a separate vulnerable snapshot (instructor provides or students intentionally misconfigure), identify three misconfigurations (e.g., world-writable /etc/cron.d, unrestricted sudo NOPASSWD, weak file permissions on sensitive files).




Fix those misconfigurations, document steps, and show before/after evidence (ls -l, getfacl, audit logs).

Produce a remediation checklist and a short policy document for ongoing user management.
